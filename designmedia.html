	<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<h2>Poster</h2>
<article>
For the poster here on the left my theme was "Lecture theater" so i wanted to incorporate creativity into the learning enviornment. I felt by having my poster sketched would indicate doodling that goes on in a lecture and the colours represent creativity.

<h2> Video 1-Before I Die</h2>
<article>
The video on the right was about a women who grew old with her husband and never did anything she wanted to do and when her husband died, she decided that life was too short to do nothing so she created a bucket list and did everything she always wanted to do.

<h2>Postage Stamp Design</h2>
<article>
My postage stamp was inspired by my personal education experience. I didnt feel good enough to go to college and all the years learning and studying meant nothing. The graduation hat and scroll represent myself achieving third level education and graduating.

<h2> Video 2- Kolours and Kuts</h2>
<article>
The aim of the video on the right was to make an advertisment and use video effects, audio and editing. My inspiration was my local hair dressers. I felt that it would be good for an advert and also good for showing my editing skills and camera techniques.
