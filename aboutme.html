<h3> Aoife Burke Portfolio</h3>
<h2 id="am">About me</h2><br />
<article>My name is Aoife Burke, I am 20 years old, I live in Clondalkin and i am currently a student studying Creative Digital Media. I am an only child and have always been creative for aslong as I can remember. I work part time on the weekend and I am a full time student during the week. I am currently a student studying in the Insitute of Technology Blanchardstown. My course title is Creative Digital media. I really enjoy this course and the creative aspects I can bring to it, the course can be quite tough at times but over all I am really enjoying the experience.

<h2 id="ih">Area of work</h2>
<article> In this course I have a lot of modules. I really like all the modules however I have not found a particular one I like most yet. I am very versatile as a person so im liking a bit of everything at the moment. However, one area I do like a lot would be editing and web development. I suppose my strongest area would be Design and editing but I do really like web development. I think i could be quite good at applying my creativity to websites with a little bit more knowledge.

<h2 id="g">Goals</h2>
<article>
I have many goals for the future however in completion of this course I hope to graduate with a well earned degree in Creative Digital media. I would really like to go on and study further in Creative Digital media and do my masters degree. I feel like it would be very interesting to be able to teach digital media and specialize in it. I then hope to take my profession out of Ireland and see where it may take me. The goals for the future are hopeful for me and I am really looking forward to what the future will bring.
